    "Predicting financial crises with accuracy is a critical task for economists, policymakers, and financial institutions, given its huge economic and social costs (Hoggarth, Reis and Saporta (2002); Ollivaud and Turner (2015); Laeven and Valencia (2018)). Recent events such as the failure of SVB Bank and the First Republic Bank, the merger of Credit Suisse, and the lingering effects of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) underscore the importance of identifying effective early warning indicators (EWIs) of financial crises that can help avert such financial upheavals and mitigate the cost of the crises. This paper presents a novel approach to the analysis and categorization of these early warning indicators, aiming to offer a more refined understanding of their predictive utility in the face of an increasingly dynamic and volatile banking landscape."

    "Previously, with Sparse-TVp modeling, our study classified a broad spectrum of explanatory variables into three distinct cate- gories: stable EWIs, time-varying EWIs, and variables irrelevant to predicting financial crises. The forecasting power of and evaluations of EWIs has not been sufficiently analyzed. Most of the existing research has been focused on identifying what variables could be considered as the EWIs, such as the work of: Aldasoro, Borio, and Drehmann in 2018 (Iñaki Aldasoro (2018)), Fahlenbrach, Prilmeier, and Stulz in 2012 (Rüdiger Fahlenbrach (2022)), or Sohn and Park in 2016 (Sohn and Park (2016)). However, these research have not considered the time varying heterogeneity in the EWIs’ importance and considered them to be static over time."

    "We employed a sparse analysis technique in the context of Bayesian inference, known as shrinkage prior distributions. We imposed shrinkage prior distributions on both the initial values and standard deviations of time-varying coeﬀicients vector to allow for the simultaneous estimation of time-varying and stable parameters, while also distin- guishing between indicators that are useful for predicting financial crises and those that are not. The application of such inference methods has recently gained theoretical understanding, and this paper is among the first to apply them to the identification of EWIs and prediction of financial crises."

    "Our paper makes two significant contributions to the field. First, we have identified a set of EWIs among various macroeconomic variables. Our analysis reveals that these EWIs consist of those that have been consistently useful over a long period, as well as those that have become effective recently: mainly since the 1980s. Stable EWIs identified include credit-to-GDP ratio and the non- core funding ratio of banks, which is in line with numerous previous studies that have attempted to identify EWIs. Variables that have gained increasing importance in recent years include the global credit-to-GDP ratio, which suggests that there is a growing need to consider global factors, not just domestic ones, in predicting and understanding financial crises."

    " Secondly, we have confirmed that our model surpasses alternative models, such as logistic regression and LASSO regression, in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy. Our results suggest that taking into account the time variation of EWIs can enhance our understanding of past crises and, at the same time, offer valuable insights into future financial crisis predictions."
